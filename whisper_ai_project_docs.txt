Current Status & Progress
We're approximately 90% through the context window, so this will be our last exchange in this conversation.
Key Accomplishments:

SimConnect Integration

Created mock_simconnect.py bridge file to resolve import dependency issues
Fixed navigation.py to handle SimConnect failures gracefully
Added toggle functionality (F7 key) to switch between real/mock SimConnect
Ensured proper cleanup when switching modes


Audio Processing Debug

Enhanced audio_processor_debug.py with detailed wake word detection logging
Added visual indicators for audio levels and transcription
Implemented detailed logging for successful/failed wake word matches
Fixed syntax errors in state_manager.py related to audio processing


State Management

Rewrote state_manager.py to handle SimConnect compatibility issues
Fixed syntax errors in handler methods (semicolon-related issues)
Improved error handling during state transitions
Enhanced cleanup during mode transitions


Other Fixes

Reduced excessive debug output for better readability
Implemented proper module reference updating when switching SimConnect modes
Normalized wake word detection for better recognition



Next Steps

Audio Optimization

Remove excessive audio device listing in audio_processor_debug.py
Reduce frequency of audio level monitoring (currently too verbose)
Fix wake word detection sensitivity issues
Test with real microphone in Flight Simulator environment


Debug Cleanup

Remove or comment out debug prints in WhisperSTT.transcribe method
Eliminate "VOICE INPUT DETECTED" prints in _listen_worker
Remove all queue polling messages in get_next_command
Consider condensing device listing to save tokens


Testing Protocol

Test wake word detection with real audio in varying noise conditions
Verify proper state transitions after wake word detection
Test SimConnect toggle functionality with Flight Simulator running
Validate proper cleanup during mode switches


Mini PC Preparation

Begin planning for distributed architecture
Consider AMD Ryzen AI or Intel Core Ultra based mini PCs
Test network communication between main PC and mini PC
Optimize memory usage for smaller hardware



Implementation Notes

The wake word detection issue may be related to audio sensitivity or transcription quality
Current audio thresholds may need adjustment (levels showing ~0.0004 are very low)
Consider trying different microphone or adjusting input gain
The main.py rewrite adds toggle functionality without breaking existing features
Focus on getting wake word detection working before proceeding to distributed architecture

Technical Debt

Excessive debug logging needs to be cleaned up
Some redundant code in audio processing modules
Error handling could be further improved in SimConnect modules
Need proper cleanup of resources in all modules

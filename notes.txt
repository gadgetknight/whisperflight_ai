AI Flight Tour Guide for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 - Project Summary
Core Functionality

An AI-powered tour guide and copilot for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
Provides location information, historical context, and points of interest while flying
Responds to voice commands in VR (Quest 3) environment
Uses multiple AI models with text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities

Technical Architecture

Main Interface: SimConnect API to interface with Microsoft Flight Simulator
Voice Processing:

Whisper for speech-to-text conversion
ElevenLabs API for text-to-speech with customizable voices


AI Models:

OpenAI: More natural responses, focuses on historical value and points of interest, but prone to hallucination after multiple exchanges
Grok: More factual/directional information (N/S/E/W), less hallucination but doesn't follow prompts as consistently
Used as alternatives depending on user preference


Hardware Setup:

Primary: VR with Quest 3 headset
Considering distributed processing between main PC (running Flight Simulator) and Jetson Xavier NX (for AI processing)
Currently experiencing performance issues when everything runs on a single PC



User Interaction

Wake Word System: "Sky Tour" activates the system (responds in Optimus Prime's voice)
Command Structure:

"Where am I?" - Gets current location information
"No" - Puts system in wait state
"Question" - Reactivates system from wait state
"Deactivate" - Turns off the system


Input Redundancy:

Voice commands (primary)
Joystick button mappings (customizable)
Keyboard shortcuts (F8, F9)



Current Challenges

Performance issues when running all components on a single PC
Speech recognition reliability and audio device configuration
AI hallucination (especially with OpenAI after multiple exchanges)
User configuration complexity

Planned Improvements

Distributed architecture: Split processing between main PC and Jetson/mini PC
Network communication via WebSockets or gRPC for low latency
More robust context management to reduce AI hallucinations
Potential hybrid approach using different AI models for different types of information
Enhanced audio processing and calibration for VR environments

Implementation Details

Modular code structure with separate components
Audio API, control main, and batch file startup
Configuration file for API keys
VR integration with visual feedback for system status

This project combines flight simulation, AI, voice recognition, and VR technologies to create an immersive tour guide experience for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.RetryBSo over the next day or so, I'm going to tell you everything I know feel, taste, 3, about the whisper AI flight tour guide and how I want it to work and what I want it to do. And then at the end of that, I'm gonna give you the code that I've already created with Grok. Have you go through it improve it, make it more robust, and stable. And helped me finish off getting it put together.EditThat sounds like a great plan. I'd be happy to help you develop and refine your Whisper AI Flight Tour Guide project. Taking a comprehensive approach by first sharing your complete vision, requirements, and experiences with the system will give me the context needed to properly understand what you're building.
Once you've shared everything about how you want it to work and the code you've already created with Grok, I can:

Review your existing code thoroughly
Suggest improvements for robustness and stability
Help optimize performance, especially for the distributed architecture
Refine the voice interaction components
Assist with finalizing the integration of all components

Feel free to share details at whatever pace works for you over the next day or so. I'll help you put all the pieces together to create a polished, stable version of your AI Flight Tour Guide.RetryBOne of the things I need to figure out how to make it do is recognize the fact that I'm flying Typically, when I'm flying, I'll be 500 to a 1000 feet traveling at 50 to a 100 miles. So If it's going to give me a point of interest, I've gotta be able to see it from that location even though I can go down and hover. Around it. To look at it, but I'm not going to land and get out and walk around and go look something. So when it's recognizing and offering points of interest, it has keep that in mind.EditThat's an excellent point about the visibility and relevance of points of interest from an aerial perspective. Flying at 500-1000 feet at 50-100 mph creates specific requirements for what makes a good point of interest.
For your AI Flight Tour Guide to suggest meaningful points of interest from this perspective, we should consider:

Visibility Criteria

Size/scale - Features need to be large enough to see from your altitude
Distinctive visual appearance - Landmarks should be recognizable from above
Color contrast with surroundings - Makes features stand out while flying past


Approach Considerations

Points of interest should be visible from multiple approach angles
The system should consider your current heading and speed when suggesting locations
Provide enough distance warning to allow for course adjustment at your current speed


Classification of Aerial-Friendly POIs

Large architectural structures (bridges, stadiums, unique buildings)
Distinctive natural features (waterfalls, unusual rock formations)
Clear historical sites with visible remains (castles, ancient structures)
Notable geographic features (river confluences, mountain peaks)
Large cultural sites (plazas, parks with distinctive layouts)


Implementation Ideas

Include altitude and size metadata for POIs in your database
Calculate a "visibility score" based on current altitude, time of day, and POI characteristics
Use directional language like "on your left in about 30 seconds" rather than just naming locations
Prioritize POIs that are suitable for aerial viewing in eVTOL craft like the Joby S4


Dynamic Recommendation Logic

For slower speeds and lower altitudes: Suggest smaller, more detailed points of interest
For higher speeds and altitudes: Focus on larger, more prominent landmarks
If hovering is detected: Offer more detailed information about what's directly below



When we review your code, we can implement a filtering system that considers these aerial viewing factors when selecting which points of interest to suggest. This would make the experience much more relevant for a pilot compared to standard tourism recommendations designed for ground-based exploration.RetryBAnother thing we're gonna have to figure out is how to adjust the microphone filtering for this in the software so that the end user can adjust it For the plane that they're flying, because some planes are gonna be moisier than others. Another idea would be to Use an external microphone so that it can't hear what's going on in the Quest 3 HeadsetEditYou're right about the microphone challenges - this is a critical aspect of making your voice interface reliable. Aircraft noise varies significantly between different planes in Flight Simulator, and the Quest 3's built-in microphones might pick up both simulated engine noise and ambient real-world sounds.
Here are some approaches we can implement for microphone filtering and configuration:
Software-Based Solutions

Adaptive Noise Filtering System

Implement a calibration routine where users can record their aircraft at different throttle settings
Create noise profiles for different aircraft types that can be selected or auto-detected
Use dynamic noise suppression that adjusts based on the current engine RPM/throttle setting


User Configuration Interface

Add a simple GUI for microphone settings with:

Noise threshold sliders (adjustable in real-time)
Frequency filtering options (to target specific engine noise frequencies)
Voice activation sensitivity controls
Test button that provides feedback on voice detection quality




Voice Activity Detection Refinement

Implement more sophisticated VAD (Voice Activity Detection) algorithms
Add "push to talk" options via controller buttons as a reliable fallback
Consider using wake word detection libraries optimized for noisy environments (like Picovoice's Porcupine)



Hardware Solutions

External Microphone Support

Add support for Bluetooth or USB microphones connected to the PC
Include a microphone selection dropdown in settings
Provide recommended microphone placement guidelines for users


PTT Hardware Integration

Support physical Push-To-Talk buttons/switches for cleaner audio capture
Allow integration with flight control hardware (yokes, HOTAS systems)


Quest-Specific Solutions

Leverage Quest's pass-through API to potentially create a floating control panel
Consider the Quest's built-in noise suppression capabilities and how to optimize them



Implementation Approach
For the code implementation, we should:

Create a modular audio input subsystem that can:

Accept input from multiple possible sources
Apply configurable filters based on user settings
Provide visual feedback on audio quality/detection


Include an audio setup wizard:

Walks users through microphone selection and placement
Tests voice commands in progressively more realistic conditions
Automatically suggests optimal filter settings


Store aircraft-specific profiles:

Allow users to save settings per aircraft
Auto-load appropriate profile when changing aircraft
Include some pre-configured profiles for popular aircraft



This approach gives users multiple ways to solve the microphone issue based on their specific setup and preferences, which is important given the variety of VR and flight control configurations people use.RetryBMicrosoft Flight Simulator has a 2024 has a new thing in it. Called the EFB, which is like a tablet. If we could put an icon in there that says, copilot or Torcay. And when I speak, it just shows the text. So it'll say pilot and then I said and then Copilot or tour guide and then what it said on there that you can see in the VR goggles. So you make sure that it heard you and understood you correctly. That would be an awesome thing to add to this product if it's not too much overhead.EditThat's a brilliant idea! Integrating with the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 would provide a natural, immersive way to confirm voice interactions. This would solve several problems at once while maintaining the simulation's realism.
Here's how we could approach implementing this EFB integration:
EFB Integration Approach

Custom EFB App Interface

Create a dedicated "Copilot" or "Tour Guide" app icon for the EFB
Design a simple, high-contrast interface visible in VR conditions
Use the SimConnect API to inject our interface into the EFB system


Conversation Display Layout

Split screen format showing:

"Pilot" section with transcribed user commands (what you said)
"Copilot/Tour Guide" section with AI responses
Small status indicator showing system state (listening, processing, idle)




Visual Feedback Elements

Audio level meter showing microphone input (helps diagnose mic issues)
Command recognition confidence score
Current system mode (tour guide, navigation, general information)
Small map showing current location and suggested POIs


Implementation Requirements

We'll need to use SimConnect's UI injection capabilities
Maintain a text log of recent interactions
Keep the interface lightweight to minimize performance impact
Ensure high contrast for VR visibility



Technical Considerations
SimConnect provides ways to create custom panels and interfaces in MSFS. We'll need to:

Create HTML/CSS interface for the EFB app

Simple, clean design with good VR readability
Support for scrolling through conversation history
Ability to show location data and POI information


Establish bidirectional communication

Send transcribed speech to the EFB display
Allow touch interaction with the EFB as an alternative input method
Update location and orientation data in real-time


Optimize for performance

Keep the UI rendering lightweight
Use efficient update patterns (only update when needed)
Cache UI elements to reduce rendering overhead



This EFB integration would be extremely valuable as it provides:

Confirmation that commands were heard correctly
Reference for what information was provided
A way to review previous interactions without relying on memory
Additional credibility by integrating with the simulator's built-in systems

The overhead shouldn't be too significant since MSFS already handles the EFB rendering pipeline - we're just injecting our content into their existing framework. This is definitely worth implementing and would significantly enhance the user experience.RetryBDuring all of our sessions writing code, I'm gonna want you to be very transparent with me. Before we implement any code. I need to approve it. And version control is gonna be very important I don't want you to just give me a snippet to replace. Every time we make a change, you're gonna rewrite. And reiterate the version. I'll give you the starting versions when we get started. But I want all that noted so that I can, have a clean trail of what we've done. And places to go back to if something really screws up. I'm also gonna want you to explain what changes you're gonna make and why you're gonna make the changes. And either highlight the change in the Claude so I can see it Claude, or give me the line numbers that you're changing. So that when I go over to Notepad plus, I can see the line and Read it. To so that I can understand more and more about Python as we go.EditI appreciate your clear requirements for our collaboration process. Being transparent and methodical with code changes is absolutely the right approach. Here's how I'll handle our coding sessions:

Version Control and Documentation

I'll track version numbers as you specify
Each code revision will be presented as a complete file, not just snippets
I'll maintain a changelog documenting what changed in each version


Change Approval Process

I'll explain proposed changes before implementing them
I'll provide clear rationale for each modification
No changes will be implemented without your explicit approval


Change Highlighting

I'll identify changes by either:

Highlighting the modified code within Claude responses
Providing specific line numbers for each change
Using a clear comparison format (before/after)




Educational Approach

I'll explain the Python concepts behind each change
I'll note why certain approaches are better than alternatives
This will help strengthen your Python knowledge throughout the process



This structured approach will give you full visibility and control over the development process while creating a clear trail of changes that you can reference if needed. It will also make it easier to understand the reasoning behind each modification to the codebase.
Is there any specific versioning format you'd prefer to use for tracking our changes?RetryBWhen we develop this program, there's gonna be several switches in the application. There'll be verbal switches. One will be in the very beginning. I'll switch I can switch between chatGBT OpenAI and Claude APIs. I'm also gonna be able to switch between 11 labs and Google. But that'll be done in the config any. And I should also be able to switch between whisper and Google. That also should be done in the config any file. And then when we build the GUI interface, for the config. We'll have a place to put in all the PI keys, and the 11 labs ID and the different products that we're gonna use, Google 11 Labs, Whisper, and so on. So that all that will be kept in a configurationEditI understand your requirements for configurable APIs and services in the application. This modular approach is excellent for flexibility and user choice. Here's how we can structure these switches and configurations:
API Selection Architecture

Service Provider Switches

LLM API switch: OpenAI, Claude, Grok
Text-to-Speech switch: ElevenLabs, Google TTS
Speech-to-Text switch: Whisper, Google Speech Recognition


Configuration Storage

Primary storage: Config.ini file
Format: Standard INI format with sections for different service types
Key storage: Secure storage of API keys for each service


Configuration GUI Features

API key input fields (with masking for security)
Service selection dropdowns
Voice/model selection for each service
Testing buttons to verify API connectivity



Implementation Strategy
For the code implementation, we'll create:

Config Manager Module

Functions to read/write the config.ini file
Secure API key handling
Default configuration generation


Service Factory Classes

Abstract base classes for each service type (LLM, TTS, STT)
Concrete implementations for each provider
Factory pattern to instantiate the appropriate service based on config


Runtime Service Switching

Allow some switches at runtime (like LLM provider)
Handle graceful transitions between services



The config.ini structure might look something like:
iniCopy[LLM]
provider = claude  # Options: openai, claude, grok
openai_api_key = YOUR_OPENAI_KEY
claude_api_key = YOUR_CLAUDE_KEY
grok_api_key = YOUR_GROK_KEY
selected_model = claude-3-sonnet-20240229

[TextToSpeech]
provider = elevenlabs  # Options: elevenlabs, google
elevenlabs_api_key = YOUR_ELEVENLABS_KEY
elevenlabs_voice_id = pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB
google_api_key = YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY

[SpeechToText]
provider = whisper  # Options: whisper, google
whisper_model = base
google_api_key = YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY

[Audio]
input_device = 1
output_device = 0
noise_threshold = 0.2
For the GUI, we'll create a straightforward configuration interface with:

Tabs for different service categories
Input fields for API keys and settings
Test buttons for each service
Save/Cancel buttons
Dynamic validation of API keys

This approach gives you the flexibility to switch between different service providers while maintaining a clean separation of concerns in the codebase. It also makes it easy to add support for new providers in the future without major code changes.RetryBI want the application to be able to track my location and guide me to a particular location. For instance, I'm in San Antonio, Texas, and I say which direction to the Alamo I expect it to give me a heading and a distance. And then tell me when I'm, like, 1 minute away from there. And tell me if I get off track. What track I need to be on, but I also wanna guard against it being a GPS. Because there is All that capability built into airplanes. But airplanes have waypoints and can track you from airport to airport. But they don't track you to a point of interest. So I want you to handle that piece, but I also don't want you to be up a GPS So I want you to guard against that. But then include what I'm asking for or argue the point not to.EditYour request for guided navigation to points of interest makes perfect sense, especially since it fills a gap between the simulator's built-in airport-to-airport navigation and the kind of tourism-focused exploration you're building.
I agree that we should implement this feature while being careful not to replicate a full GPS system. Here's how I'd approach this:
Point of Interest Navigation Framework

Destination Setting

Voice command parsing for "which direction to [landmark]"
Geocoding of landmarks/POIs using coordinates database
Confirmation of selected destination ("Heading to the Alamo in San Antonio")


Directional Guidance

Initial heading and approximate distance information
Occasional updates only when significantly off course (not constant turn-by-turn)
Narrative-style directions rather than precise GPS instructions


Proximity Alerts

Notification when approximately 1 minute away based on current speed
Alert when landmark should be visible from current altitude
Optional description of what to look for ("You should see the distinctive roof on your right")



How This Differs From GPS

Information Style

Use pilot-friendly terminology (headings, bearings, distances)
Focus on landmarks and visual references over precise routes
Provide cultural/historical context alongside directional information


Update Frequency

Only provide updates when requested or when significantly off course
Avoid constant "recalculating" or turn-by-turn instructions
Emphasize general direction over exact pathfinding


Integration with Tour Guide Role

Frame direction-giving as part of the tour experience
Include interesting facts about areas you're flying over en route
Maintain conversational tone rather than robotic GPS instructions



Technical Implementation
For implementation, we'll need:

Great-circle distance calculations between coordinates
Heading calculations based on current position and target
Time-to-arrival estimation based on current speed
A threshold-based system for course correction alerts

I believe this approach gives you the navigation assistance you need while maintaining the tour guide character of the application and avoiding duplication of the simulator's built-in navigation systems.
Does this approach align with what you had in mind for the feature?RetryBI also want you to make sure that when we put this work out there, for public consumption, whether I give it to someone or I sell it to someone that my work is protected and possibly even copyrighted So whatever have to put in the application to make sure that happens or how we can pilot it. And or applying for copyright notices, then I need you to recommend that stuff to me as we go along.EditI'll definitely help ensure your work is properly protected. Here's what we should implement to safeguard your intellectual property:

As we develop the application, I'll point out specific opportunities to implement these protections and suggest code that supports proper IP safeguarding. I'll also help you draft any necessary legal text for licenses and agreements, though you should have these reviewed by a legal professional before finalizing them.
Would you like to focus on any particular aspect of IP protection as we begin development?RetryBCreate a summary of all the things I've asked you to do so. Far in the flight tour guide.
